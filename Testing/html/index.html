                    <h3>Game Developer & Designer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Well, it all started when I was in high school, since there, my favorite hobby is playing
                        video-games.
                        for those times, I was thinking, "why not make my own games?" <br>
                        But I have a problem, I'm not a great artist.
                        Hopefully, in this sector, it is not only about art, but also about programming.
                        Casually there is a optional computer science class in mmy school, so I decided to take it.
                        And I found that pretty interesting, and I started to loving it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the high school, I wanted to chose the game development as my career in the college to
                        learn more aboutit.
                        But the college requires a higher score in the entrance exam than I have, so I failed to enter
                        in that carrer.<br>
                        I didn't give up, I chose the computer science as my major,
                        sadly, when I was in the college, started the pandemic, and the telematic classes are not as
                        good as the
                        presential classes.
                        So I decided to look for a better way to learn game development, then I found a online school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        here, I learned a lot of things about game development, and I'm still learning.
