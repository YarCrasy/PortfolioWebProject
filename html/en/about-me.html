        <p>Greetings! My name is <b>LINGCHENG JIANG,</b> also known as Yar Crasy. You can just call me Yar.
          I'm a game developer born in 2001.</p>

        <h1>Why a Game Developer</h1>
        <p>
          Well, it all started when I was in high school, since there, my favorite hobby is playing video-games.
          for those times, I was thinking, "why not make my own games?" <br>
          But I have a problem, I'm not a great artist.
          Hopefully, in this sector, it is not only about art, but also about programming.
          Casually there is a optional computer science class in mmy school, so I decided to take it.
          And I found that pretty interesting, and I started to loving it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the high school, I wanted to chose the game development as my career in the college to learn more about
          it.
          But the college requires a higher score in the entrance exam than I have, so I failed to enter in that carrer.
          But I didn't give up, I chose the computer science as my major,
          sadly, when I was in the college, started the pandemic, and the telematic classes are not as good as the
          presential classes.
          So I decided to look for a better way to learn game development, then I found a online school called: <b>Tokio
            School</b>.
